# crud-mono-repo-template

Just a generic boring CRUD mono repo template

Choose from one of the following branches:

## base-skeleton

Completely barebones, no technologies for either web or server. Only techs chosen are pnpm workspaces, husky (pre-commit), TS base config, prettier, Typescript; no frameworks

## main

A batteries-included, opinionated CRUD monorepo with a modern TS stack:

Frontend: React + Vite (TypeScript)

Backend: Fastify (TypeScript)

DB/ORM: PostgreSQL + Prisma (migrations & seeding)

Tooling: still pnpm workspaces, Husky (pre-commit), Prettier, TypeScript
